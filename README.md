# Self-hosted AI Masterbrain ðŸš€

**Local AI development stack** with n8n, Supabase, Ollama, WebUI, Crawl4AI, Qdrant, and more.  
Ideal for building your own RAG workflows, data agents, and secure AI experiments â€“ locally or in the cloud.

This is Wolf's version with a couple of improvements and the addition of Crawl4ai, NLP-Container and Dashboard with Auth. 

Also, the local RAG AI Agent workflows from the video (by Cole) will be automatically in your 
n8n instance if you use this setup instead of the base one provided by n8n!

**IMPORANT**: Supabase has updated a couple environment variables so you may have to add some new default values in your .env that I have in my .env.example if you have had this project up and running already and are just pulling new changes. Specifically, you need to add "POOLER_DB_POOL_SIZE=5" to your .env. This is required if you have had the package running before June 14th.

### Whatâ€™s included

âœ… [**Self-hosted n8n**](https://n8n.io/) - Low-code platform with over 400
integrations and advanced AI components

âœ… [**New: Dashboard with Auth**] - Grid overview of all available services with 
auth when public (vps), no auth on local (work in progress)

âœ… [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/) - Open source database as a service -
most widely used database for AI agents

âœ… [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/) - Cross-platform LLM platform to install
and run the latest local LLMs

âœ… [**Open WebUI**](https://openwebui.com/) - ChatGPT-like interface to
privately interact with your local models and N8N agents

âœ… [**Flowise**](https://flowiseai.com/) - No/low code AI agent
builder that pairs very well with n8n

âœ… [**New: Crawl4ai**](https://crawl4ai.com/) - scraping / crawling 4 LLM usage or data aggregation, screenshots, etc. 

âœ… [**New: Python NLP Container**] - special container for python tools like flask, spyCy, pandas, and more

âœ… [**Qdrant**](https://qdrant.tech/) - Open source, high performance vector
store with an comprehensive API. Even though you can use Supabase for RAG, this was
kept unlike Postgres since it's faster than Supabase so sometimes is the better option.

âœ… [**Neo4j**](https://neo4j.com/) - Knowledge graph engine that powers tools like GraphRAG, LightRAG, and Graphiti 

âœ… [**SearXNG**](https://searxng.org/) - Open source, free internet metasearch engine which aggregates 
results from up to 229 search services. Users are neither tracked nor profiled, hence the fit with the local AI package.

âœ… [**Caddy**](https://caddyserver.com/) - Managed HTTPS/TLS for custom domains

âœ… [**Langfuse**](https://langfuse.com/) - Open source LLM engineering platform for agent observability
