# 3. Start Script: `start_services.py`

The `start_services.py` script provides robust container lifecycle management.


### What it does

1. Updates Supabase repo & generates config
2. Stops all containers, removes orphans
3. Waits for ports to be released
4. Starts Supabase first, then AI stack
5. Checks health of each service

Volumes are safe by default unless `--remove-volumes` is passed.

---

The project includes a `start_services.py` script that handles starting both the Supabase and local AI services. The script accepts a `--profile` flag to specify which GPU configuration to use.

### For Nvidia GPU users

```bash
python start_services.py --profile gpu-nvidia
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not used your Nvidia GPU with Docker before, please follow the
> [Ollama Docker instructions](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/docker.md).

### For AMD GPU users on Linux

```bash
python start_services.py --profile gpu-amd
```

### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

If you're using a Mac with an M1 or newer processor, you can't expose your GPU to the Docker instance, unfortunately. There are two options in this case:

1. Run the starter kit fully on CPU:
   ```bash
   python start_services.py --profile cpu
   ```

2. Run Ollama on your Mac for faster inference, and connect to that from the n8n instance:
   ```bash
   python start_services.py --profile none
   ```

   If you want to run Ollama on your mac, check the [Ollama homepage](https://ollama.com/) for installation instructions.

#### For Mac users running OLLAMA locally

If you're running OLLAMA locally on your Mac (not in Docker), you need to modify the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable in the n8n service configuration. Update the x-n8n section in your Docker Compose file as follows:

```yaml
x-n8n: &service-n8n
  # ... other configurations ...
  environment:
    # ... other environment variables ...
    - OLLAMA_HOST=host.docker.internal:11434
```

Additionally, after you see "Editor is now accessible via: http://localhost:5678/":

1. Head to http://localhost:5678/home/credentials
2. Click on "Local Ollama service"
3. Change the base URL to "http://host.docker.internal:11434/"

### For everyone else

```bash
python start_services.py --profile cpu
```

### The environment argument
The **start-services.py** script offers the possibility to pass one of two options for the environment argument, **private** (default environment) and **public**:
- **private:** you are deploying the stack in a safe environment, hence a lot of ports can be made accessible without having to worry about security
- **public:** the stack is deployed in a public environment, which means the attack surface should be made as small as possible. All ports except for 80 and 443 are closed

The stack initialized with
```bash
   python start_services.py --profile gpu-nvidia --environment private
```
equals the one initialized with
```bash
   python start_services.py --profile gpu-nvidia
```
